	    Currently, I am in my second semester at Millersville University, 
	    and I am a Computer Science major who is interested in becoming 
	    a Software Engineer. The first language that I am learning is Java. 
	    Java as of now seems to be an uninteresting language, but I 
	    believe that once I understand a few more concepts I will be able to 
	    understand how to create beautiful and complex program which is why I 
	    aspire to become a Software Engineer. During my last semester, I learned 
	    a decent amount about programming and the Java programming language 
	    which was my only reason for going to college so that gives me a good 
	    drive to continue my academics which is good since usually a master's 
	    degree is needed to get a job as a Software Engineer, or 5 to 10 years 
	    experience, but I would prefer a 2-year graduate degree.
	    This entry may seem to be uninteresting. Well, I would have to agree. 
	    From an outside viewpoint, especially from someone who isn't a Computer 
	    Science major, this entry is boring. However, what interests me is not the 
	    "norm" which is why as I write this entry I'm listening to the show, 
	    House, M.D. Additionally, I have been teaching myself Java in my spare 
	    time since independent studying is needed in the Computer Science field 
	    which is why in CSCI 362: Data Structures in C++ you have to learn C++ in 
	    2 weeks which seems hard especially since I can take it next semester, but 
	    jobs expect you to do the same with their proprietary programming languages,
	    and since it is easier to learn a language after you have mastered one since 
	    programming languages are written similarly, it is expected of everyone.
	    Furthermore, I have been attempting to teach myself how to program a graphical
	    user interface, and as I said, I am attempting since it is complex with multiple 
	    "moving" parts. However, I'm rather certain with more scrutiny of the different 
	    objects and methods I'll be able to make functional and more complex graphical 
	    user interfaces.

	    Today, I found out that I didn't do as well as I believed that I was going to do on
	    on my Introduction to Programming 2 exam. The reason for this occurrence seems to be
	    because of the poor asked questions. The reason that I say this statement isn't only
	    because I am upset about the news but because of the fact that everyone thought the
	    same.
